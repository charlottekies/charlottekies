- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @charlottekies
- :orange_heart: Iâ€™m interested in languages (spoken and programming), Java, React, and using what I've learned to contribute to seriously impactful, or useless but goofy/fun projects
- :school: Iâ€™m currently learning about Natural Language Processing!
- :hammer: I am building [A Web APIs Demo App!](https://github.com/charlottekies/web-apis-demo) A responsive, full stack application that makes use of REST, RPC, and GraphQL APIs. The site is built using PostgreSQL, React, Prisma, and Next.js, and it is currently deployed to AWS and Vercel! [View Live!](https://web-apis-demo.vercel.app/).
- :abacus: I am currently building a [java-based educational project](https://github.com/charlottekies/algorithms) for bootcamp graduates that will provide structured practice implementing fundamental algorithm patterns.
