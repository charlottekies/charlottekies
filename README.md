- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @charlottekies
- :orange_heart: Iâ€™m interested music & audio engineering, languages (spoken and programming), Java, React, and using what I've learned to contribute to seriously impactful, or useless but goofy projects
- :school: Iâ€™m currently learning [JUCE](https://juce.com/) and [Elementary Audio](https://www.elementary.audio/)!
- :hammer: I am building [A Web APIs Demo App!](https://github.com/charlottekies/web-apis-demo) A responsive, full stack application that makes use of REST, RPC, and GraphQL APIs. The site is built using PostgreSQL, React, Prisma, and Next.js, and it is currently deployed to AWS and Vercel! [View Live!](https://web-apis-demo.vercel.app/).
