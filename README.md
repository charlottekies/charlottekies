- 👋 Hi, I’m @charlottekies
- :orange_heart: I’m interested in languages (spoken and programming), Java, React, and using what I've learned to contribute to seriously impactful, or useless but goofy/fun projects.
- :school: I’m currently learning about Natural Language Processing!
- :hammer: I recently put together a [A Web APIs Demo App!](https://github.com/charlottekies/web-apis-demo) It's a responsive, full stack application that leverages REST, RPC, and GraphQL APIs. The site is built using PostgreSQL, React, Prisma, and Next.js, and it is [currently deployed to AWS and Vercel!](https://web-apis-demo.vercel.app/).
- :abacus: I am currently building a [java-based educational project](https://github.com/charlottekies/algorithms) for bootcamp graduates that will provide structured practice implementing fundamental algorithm patterns.
- ⭐ I am also developing a [Java algorithm utility library](https://github.com/charlottekies/algo-utils) that provides sorting and searching methods implemented with fundamental algorithm patterns.
