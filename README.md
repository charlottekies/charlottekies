- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @charlottekies
- :orange_heart: Iâ€™m interested languages, mobile development, and using what I've learned to contribute to seriously impactful, or useless but hilarious projects
- :school: Iâ€™m currently learning SwiftUI 
- :hammer: I am building the backend of a collaborative web-based, instrument-assignments project. The site is built in Java, PostgreSQL, React.ts, and Next.ts, and is currently hosted on AWS. [Read our project wiki](https://github.com/RubySpeeders/US-Navy-Project/wiki), or check out the repo in my pinned repos below.
