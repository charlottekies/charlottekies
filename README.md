- :orange_heart: Iâ€™m interested languages, mobile development, and using what I've learned to contribute to seriously impactful, or useless but hilarious projects
- :school: Iâ€™m currently learning SwiftUI 
- :hammer: I am building [Drum Roulette!](https://github.com/RubySpeeders/US-Navy-Project)! A collaborative, web-based, musical instrument assignments application. The site is built using PostgreSQL, React.ts, and Next, and it is currently deployed to AWS, Vercel, and GitHub pages!
